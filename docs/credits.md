# Credits

I would not have pushed this very far were it not for flakes and
[flake-parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts). I've gotten several
rounds of useful feedback directly from discussions on the `flake-parts`
repository as well as learned a lot from studying its code.

I also take some inspiration from
[`oxalica/rust-overlay`](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay).
